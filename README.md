# Social noSQL API

## Description
In this challenge I created routes to GET, POST, CREATE & DELETE thoughts and users. I also added routes to ADD & DELETE friends. Using mongoose we are able to use all of these routes to get data back from the database and post it to the sever via JSON data. When using HTTPie the user can use all of these routes to test the functionality of the code.

## Usage
The user can start the server and test functionality on HTTPie. When using the correct routes the user can GET, POST, CREATE & DELETE users and thoughs.
